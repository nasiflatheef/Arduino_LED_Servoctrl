# Arduino_LED_Servoctrl
This project demonstrates simultaneous control of an LED and a Servo motor using an Arduino UNO. The LED blinks at a 1-second interval while the servo motor automatically moves between 0 and 90 degrees.


## Features
- Automatic servo movement between 0° and 90°
- 1-second interval LED blinking
- Non-blocking operation using millis()

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino UNO
- SG90 Servo Motor (or similar 5V servo)
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Pin Configuration
- LED: Pin 13 (with 220Ω resistor)
- Servo: Pin 9
- Power: 5V and GND
